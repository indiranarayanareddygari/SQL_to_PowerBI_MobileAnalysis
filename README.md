# Mobile Device Data Analysis Project

This repository contains SQL queries, Power BI visualizations, and data analysis derived from a mobile device dataset. 
The project primarily focuses on querying, analyzing, and visualizing mobile device data using MySQL Workbench for database operations and Power BI for visual representation.

## Project Overview

### Data Source
- The dataset used for analysis: [CSV file]({https://github.com/indiranarayanareddygari/SQL_to_PowerBI_MobileAnalysis/blob/main/Mobile%20Analysis.csv})

### SQL Queries
The SQL queries written in MySQL Workbench aimed to answer specific questions about the mobile device data:
1. List of phone names and their prices.
2. Prices of the 5 most expensive and 5 cheapest phones.
3. Top 5 Samsung phones with prices and features.
4. Must-have Android and iOS phones categorized by high and low prices.
5. Query for identifying 5G-supported phones and listing the top 5 among them.
6. Calculating the total price of all mobile devices categorized by brand name.

### Power BI Visualizations
#### Mobile Device Analysis Dashboard
This dashboard showcases essential insights derived from the dataset using Power BI visualizations:
1. Top 5 Highest Priced Mobiles Overview (Multi-row Card)
2. Distribution of Phones by Operating System (Pie Chart)
3. Operating System Selection (Slicer)
4. Phone Count by Price Range Trend (Line Chart)
5. Top 5 Lowest Priced Phones Analysis (Stacked Area Chart)
6. Phone Name vs Total Price (Table)
7. Price and Internal Storage Comparison (Stacked Column Chart)

#### Comprehensive Mobile Market Snapshot
This snapshot provides a detailed view of the mobile device market through Power BI visualizations:
1. Total Mobile Devices (Card Visual)
2. List of Mobile Phone Models (Table)
3. Brands Distribution (Table)
4. Mobile Distribution by Operating System (Clustered Column Chart)
5. Distribution of Mobiles by Battery Capacity Range (Pie Chart)
6. Mobiles with 5G Availability (Clustered Bar Chart)
7. Brands Proportion in Mobile Market (Treemap)
8. Mobiles Based on Internal Storage (Stacked Column Chart)
9. Selfie Camera Distribution in Mobile Devices (Donut Chart)

## Getting Started
